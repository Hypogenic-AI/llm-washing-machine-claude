  - 280 English noun compounds with compositionality ratings
  - 180 Portuguese noun compounds
  - P1, P2, P3 sentence variants in neutral contexts
  - Input files with sentence IDs and compositionality scores

**Data Format:**
The dataset provides CSV files with the following structure:
- English data: `dataset/en/neutral/P1_sents.csv`, `P2_sents.csv`, `P3_sents.csv`

- Each compound includes: compound name, compositionality score, example sentences

**Sample Compounds with Compositionality Scores:**
```
academy award             3.52  (moderately compositional)
acid test                 1.22  (mostly idiomatic)

application form          4.8   (highly compositional)
```

**Notes:**
- The dataset is based on Reddy et al. (2011) compositionality dataset

**Data Format:**
CSV with columns: compound, compositionality, sentence1, sentence2, sentence3

**Note:**

**Files:**
1. `MAGPIE_filtered_split_random.jsonl` - 48,395 instances
   - 75% annotation confidence threshold
   - Binary labels (idiomatic/literal)
   - Random train/dev/test split

2. `MAGPIE_filtered_split_typebased.jsonl` - 48,395 instances
   - Same filtering as above
   - Type-based split (no idiom overlap between splits)

3. `MAGPIE_unfiltered.jsonl` - 56,622 instances
   - All annotations regardless of confidence
   - 5-way labels: i (idiomatic), l (literal), f (figurative), o (other), ? (unknown)

**Data Format:**
JSON Lines with fields:
- `idiom`: The potentially idiomatic expression (e.g., "off the beaten track")
- `label`: Sense label (i/l/f/o/?)
- `confidence`: Annotation confidence (0.0-1.0)
- `context`: List of surrounding sentences
- `label_distribution`: Distribution of annotator judgments
- `split`: train/dev/test designation
- `genre`: BNC genre classification
- `offsets`: Character positions in sentence

**Sample Entry:**
```json
{
  "idiom": "off the beaten track",
  "label": "i",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "judgment_count": 3,
  "context": ["...", "how about some ideas for safe running off the beaten track?", "..."]
}
```

**Note:**
The HuggingFace version `gsarti/magpie` exists but uses deprecated dataset scripts. The GitHub repository provides the complete, usable dataset.

### Dataset 4: Custom Compound Nouns Test Set - SUCCESS
- **Status:** Created successfully
- **Location:** `/data/hypogenicai/workspaces/llm-washing-machine-claude/datasets/compound_nouns_test.jsonl`
- **Size:** 4.5 KB (35 compounds)
- **Contents:**
  - 35 carefully selected compound nouns
  - Spans full compositionality spectrum (1-5 rating)
  - Hand-curated with explanatory notes

**Compositionality Distribution:**
- **Rating 5 (Fully compositional):** 8 compounds
  - Examples: "coffee table", "brick house", "mountain cabin", "garden hose"

- **Rating 4 (Partially compositional):** 9 compounds
  - Examples: "washing machine", "swimming pool", "parking lot", "driving license"

- **Rating 3 (Moderately compositional):** 6 compounds
  - Examples: "living room", "blackboard", "greenhouse", "redhead"

- **Rating 2 (Weakly compositional):** 4 compounds
  - Examples: "shooting star", "guinea pig", "strawberry", "eggplant"

- **Rating 1 (Non-compositional/Idiomatic):** 8 compounds
  - Examples: "hot dog", "butterfly", "deadline", "bookworm", "ladybug"

**Data Format:**
```json
{
  "compound": "washing machine",
  "word1": "washing",
  "word2": "machine",
  "compositionality_rating": 4,
  "notes": "Partially compositional - a machine for washing, but 'washing' is typically clothing-specific"
}
```

**Purpose:**
This dataset is specifically designed to:
- Test LLM representations across compositionality levels
- Include the target compound "washing machine" (rating: 4)
- Provide clear reference examples for each compositionality level
- Facilitate controlled experiments on compound noun understanding

2. Verified for correct format
3. Sampled to confirm data integrity
4. Documented with README files
5. Protected with .gitignore rules

## Next Steps

Suggested research workflows:

1. **Baseline Analysis:**
   - Load custom test set (35 compounds)
   - Extract LLM representations
   - Correlate with compositionality ratings

2. **Large-Scale Validation:**
   - Use Reddy et al. data (281 compounds) for validation
   - Compare against human compositionality judgments
   - Use NCS dataset for cross-lingual analysis

3. **Idiomaticity Studies:**
   - Use MAGPIE filtered data for binary classification
   - Train/test on type-based split for generalization
   - Use unfiltered data for fine-grained analysis

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation:**
   - Combine all datasets for multi-faceted analysis
   - Focus on "washing machine" and similar partial compositional cases
   - Compare compositional vs. non-compositional representations
