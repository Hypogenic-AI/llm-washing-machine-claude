  title: Where is Washing Machine stored in LLMs?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'In large language models, specific compound concepts such as ''washing
    machine'' may not be represented by a unique direction or nearly orthogonal direction
    in the residual stream; instead, the model may store the concept of ''washing''
    and rely on context to increase the likelihood of ''machine'' following it.

    '
  background:
    description: There are too many referenceable things for each to have a direction,
      or even a 'nearly orthogonal' direction in the residual stream. Where is 'washing
      machine' stored in LLMs? Or is just 'washing' stored and then it's assumed that
      machine becomes more likely?
